## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! I've created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  * The grid has two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).
